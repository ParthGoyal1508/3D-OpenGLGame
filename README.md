# New Features!

# Installation

Jet Fighter Simulation requires C++ and OpenGl to run.
The following development packages of the following libraries should be installed:
 - GLEW
 - GLFW3
 - GLM
 - AO
 - libmpg123

Installation instructions
### For Fedora
```
$ sudo pkgconf-pkg-config dnf install glew-devel glfw-devel glm-devel cmake pkgconf 
```
### For Ubuntu
```
$ sudo apt install libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libglm-dev cmake pkg-config
```
(Use apt-get if you donâ€™t have aptitude installed but I suggest installing it)
### For Mac
Install homebrew
```
brew install glew glfw glm cmake pkg-config
```
### For Other distros
Use the equivalent of apt search or dnf search and make sure you install the devel packages
### Driver Issues
If you do face driver issues, try to update your drivers. If you continue facing issues even after installing, I suggest you update your operating system to the latest stable release. You can also try building the libraries, but it would be a waste of time IMO.
